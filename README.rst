================
Django Warehouse
================
A simple warehouse management app for Django.
There are probably other implementations of the same use-case out there but 
this is mine.
For starters the main thing will be Items, transactions of items
and item locations.

Future
------
In no order what so ever...

- Managing batches
- Item identifiers, ie barcodes
- Support for different currency codes in prices
